# README

This is a test project to accompany the [Rivers Agile blog post discussing GitHub Actions](https://www.riversagile.com/github-actions-ci/). This repo is only intended to help read along with the repo, and should not be used to do your own tests with GitHub Actions. Feel free to copy my code into your own repo if you'd like to try something out.

## Branches

- features/basic_workflow_test - Contains simple libraries and unit tests, with a workflow that builds and runs unit tests
- (tbd) - Adds an AWS lambda function and a workflow that pushes files to the web

## Doctor Who
